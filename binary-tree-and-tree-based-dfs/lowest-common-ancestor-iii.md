# Lowest Common Ancestor III

## Description

Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor\(LCA\) of the two nodes.  
The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.  
Return `null` if LCA does not exist.

## Example

For the following binary tree:

```text
  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
```

LCA\(3, 5\) = `4`

LCA\(5, 6\) = `7`

LCA\(6, 7\) = `7`

## Solution
