# Design Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Example

```text
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

## Follow up

Could you do better than O\(n2\) per `move()` operation?

## Solution

最最简单的方法，就是拿一个二维数组来存，然后每次move之后check一下棋盘的状况，时间复杂度为O\(n^2\)。

当然，我们再一想，就会发现每次下棋，受影响的只有横竖两列，最多再加上对角线。所以，check可以优化到O\(n\)。

再一想，其实这个游戏的记录，只需要知道每行每列两位玩家的棋子数就可以了，然后O\(1\)时间完成所有操作。

这题不写了。。

这是discussion里O\(1\)的解法，看看吧，没必要写：

```java
public class TicTacToe {
private int[] rows;
private int[] cols;
private int diagonal;
private int antiDiagonal;

/** Initialize your data structure here. */
public TicTacToe(int n) {
    rows = new int[n];
    cols = new int[n];
}

/** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
    @param row The row of the board.
    @param col The column of the board.
    @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
    @return The current winning condition, can be either:
            0: No one wins.
            1: Player 1 wins.
            2: Player 2 wins. */
public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
    int toAdd = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
    
    rows[row] += toAdd;
    cols[col] += toAdd;
    if (row == col)
    {
        diagonal += toAdd;
    }
    
    if (col == (cols.length - row - 1))
    {
        antiDiagonal += toAdd;
    }
    
    int size = rows.length;
    if (Math.abs(rows[row]) == size ||
        Math.abs(cols[col]) == size ||
        Math.abs(diagonal) == size  ||
        Math.abs(antiDiagonal) == size)
    {
        return player;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
}
```
