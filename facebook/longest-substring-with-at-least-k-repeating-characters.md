# Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

## Description

Find the length of the longest substring **T** of a given string \(consists of lowercase letters only\) such that every character in **T** appears no less than k times.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```

## Solution

本来对于这种substring的题目，我本人第一反应就是sliding window，然后，好像并不能。。

无解。。
