# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

## Description

Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most _two_ transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

## Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution

有点儿意思。。

有了一个很重要的想法，在一个递增序列上面，只需要买卖一次就能获取最大利润。

妈蛋，有点懵逼，看一下答案吧。。topic是DP

有点6，虽然高票答案的DP看起来很简洁，但绝不是那么容易能够想到的。。

至于普通的解法的话，妈勒个鸡，头晕，不想去看。。

自己思考吧

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int hold1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, hold2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int release1 = 0, release2 = 0;
        for(int i:prices){                              // Assume we only have 0 money at first
            release2 = Math.max(release2, hold2+i);     // The maximum if we've just sold 2nd stock so far.
            hold2    = Math.max(hold2,    release1-i);  // The maximum if we've just buy  2nd stock so far.
            release1 = Math.max(release1, hold1+i);     // The maximum if we've just sold 1nd stock so far.
            hold1    = Math.max(hold1,    -i);          // The maximum if we've just buy  1st stock so far. 
        }
        return release2; ///Since release1 is initiated as 0, so release2 will always higher than release1.
    }
}
```
